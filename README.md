# GDIM32 In Class Activities
## Author: Kai Castilliano


## Week 1
### Activity 1

Some advice that my table and I had came up with would be :

- Take good notes that you can look back to come time where we need to apply our learning
-  Take advantage of support when in need of assistance: peers, LAs, Office hours. 
- Don't wait last minute to do things, don't procrastinate minigames because you never know if you have to get extra assistance 
- Take the time to read the pre-learnign slides. 
- Ask Questions if unclear about something. 
- Look for resources out of class for more details about something you're confused about. (Youtube, Unity Documents)
- Map out concepts in order to condense anything confusing. 
- Create metaphors. 

### Activity 2

### Activity 2
[Here is the link to the progress I made in MG2](https://github.com/UCI-GDIM32-W25/mg2-kxcastilliano/commit/ef0f744b5eea515811ec948e213fb6c4d6505cd2)

In this commit I had created the scene for my game and establihed the hiearchy by makign gameobjects such as the player, the canvas, the ground etc. I had then proceeded to make the two classes for the minigame (player and Gamecontroller) and
once that was completed I had spent my time breaking down the player script and working on the player's jump function (also added all colliders to objects).
