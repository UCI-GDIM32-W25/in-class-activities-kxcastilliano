# GDIM32 In Class Activities
## Author: Kai Castilliano


## Week 1
### Activity 1

Some advice that my table and I had came up with would be :

- Take good notes that you can look back to come time where we need to apply our learning
-  Take advantage of support when in need of assistance: peers, LAs, Office hours. 
- Don't wait last minute to do things, don't procrastinate minigames because you never know if you have to get extra assistance 
- Take the time to read the pre-learnign slides. 
- Ask Questions if unclear about something. 
- Look for resources out of class for more details about something you're confused about. (Youtube, Unity Documents)
- Map out concepts in order to condense anything confusing. 
- Create metaphors.
